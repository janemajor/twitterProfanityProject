# The Twitter Profanity Project
This program is designed to scan the tweets of a given twitter user and return tweets that contain profanity. 
I tried to do a flask thing with it but for some reason could not succeed in that endeavor. 
But this works. Input any twitter user and you will see a list and dataframe of all of their tweets that contain potential profanity (out of the user's previous 100 tweets)
